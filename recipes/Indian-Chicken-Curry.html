        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cups cubed cooked chicken breast</li>
        <Li>1 (15.25 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</Li>
        <li>1 (15.2 ounce) can corn, drained</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>

        <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
        </strong></em>
     </ul>

     <h2>Directions</h2>
       <ol>
        <strong><em>

        <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>

        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken 
            in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. 
            Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>

        <li>Add chicken, beans, corn, cream of chicken soup, 
            tomatoes and chiles (with juice), green chiles, cream 
            cheese, and cilantro. Cook until cream cheese has melted, 
            about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Spread out 1/3 of the chips on the bottom of a 9x13 
            inch rectangular casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the chicken 
            mixture. Top chicken mixture with 1/3 of shredded Cheddar 
            cheese. Repeat the layer. Top the 2nd layer with remaining 
            1/3 of the chips and remaining 1/3 of Cheddar cheese.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted and is 
            lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, 
            cover, and let sit for 30 minutes so it can set before 
            cutting into squares.</li>
